# Fake News Detection

This project implements a machine learning-based solution for classifying news articles as **real** or **fake**. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques, it processes news text data to assess credibility.

## Project Overview:
The system takes news headlines as input and predicts whether the news is real or fake. The model is trained using a labeled dataset of news articles sourced from Kaggle. It employs text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. The machine learning model utilizes **Multinomial Naive Bayes** with **Count Vectorizer** for feature extraction.

### Key Features:
- **Data Collection**: Dataset containing real and fake news articles.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Model**: Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## Technologies:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and metrics.
- **Streamlit**: Frontend interface for user interaction.
